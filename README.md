# Modular-Robotic-Arm
An open source robotic arm project based on 3D printed modular joints which can be configured into a 5/6/7 DoF arm. the design is based on a 2 DoF module which can be cascaded together to form an arm with varying DoF. A seperate single actuator can be attached to the end to create odd DoF. The design was inspired by UC Berkeley [Project Blue](https://rll.berkeley.edu/blue/).

## Single Module
the single module uses diffirential bevel gear design with 1:6 gear reduction making it a Qausi Direct drive design with good back drivability.

### Prototype of the design. 
A 3d printed protoype was made and tested.

## Limitations
the design is work in progress and needs several improvements.
1. The motor size is sufficient for wrist and elbow join but not strong enough for should/biceps. the design needs to be modified to acomudate bigger and stronger motor.
2. The central and side support beams need to be made thicker to prevent flexing under load.
3. The rear attachment point is hard to assemble, needs to be modified for easier assembly.

work in progress on a new design for the bicep joint with much stronger motors (high torque, very low KV).
